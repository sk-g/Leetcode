#719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance
"""

Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B.

Example 1:
Input:
nums = [1,3,1]
k = 1
Output: 0 
Explanation:
Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
Note:
2 <= len(nums) <= 10000.
0 <= nums[i] < 1000000.
1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2

Difficulty: Hard
Company:	Google
idea: Use binary search to see if there are k possible pairs with sum < guess
