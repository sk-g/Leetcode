# Leetcode
My solutions for problems on Leetcode
Currently most solutions will be in Python
and I will try to write out solutions in C/C++ as well.

I will probably do a weekly update with more than one approach to problems.
If help was taken from some other source, I will post links in the comments of the code, be sure to check them out.
